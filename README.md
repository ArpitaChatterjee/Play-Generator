# RNNs-Play-Generator
 We are going to use a RNN to generate a play. We will simply show the RNN an example of something we want it to recreate and it will learn how to write a version of it on its own. We'll do this using a character predictive model that will take as input a variable length sequence and predict the next character. We can use the model many times in a row with the output from the last prediction as the input for the next call to generate a sequence.
